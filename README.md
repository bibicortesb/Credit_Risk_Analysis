# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
In credit risk there is a challenge for classification, since good loans outnumber risky loans, therefore a model need to be built considereing unbalanced classes. By preparing data, statistical reasoning, and machine learning techniques, the analysis inteds to explore different models to predict risk (high/low). 

The following machine learning algorithms were used:
- RandomOverSampler (oversampling)
- SMOTE (oversampling)
- ClusterCentroids (undersampling)
- SMOTEENN (Over and Under sampling)
- BalancedRandomForestClassifier
- EasyEnsembleClassifier


## Results

For all the models, the following structure was followed:

- Split the Data into Training and Testing
- Create features and target
- Traing the model
- Test
